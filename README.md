## .NET MAUI and MVVM

**.NET MAUI** - is a multi-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop applications. It is a part of the .NET 6 release. It is based on Xamarin.Forms and uses the same concepts and APIs.

**Xamarin.Forms** - is a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows creating native user interface layouts that can be shared across Android, iOS, and Windows.

**MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) - is a design pattern (architecture) used primarily in UI-based applications to separate the concerns of data, user interface, and business logic. MVVM is widely used in XAML-based frameworks such as .NET MAUI, WPF, and Xamarin.Forms.
- **Model** (M): Represents the data and business logic of the application. It handles all the operations related to retrieving, storing, and updating the data (e.g., interacting with databases or APIs);
- **View** (V): Represents the user interface (UI). This is typically written in XAML in .NET MAUI. The view binds to the data exposed by the ViewModel, reacting to changes in the data to update the UI dynamically;
- **ViewModel** (VM): Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It exposes data and commands to the View through data binding and handles UI-related logic. It communicates with the Model to retrieve and update data, without the View directly interacting with the Model;

## Navigation

- **MainPage**
	- is the welcome screen of the app;
	- displays the company’s logo (in the form of a puzzle animation effect) and a slogan ("Discover the Classics") that appears with a typewriter effect;
	- after the animation completes, the user is automatically navigated to the **LoginPage** (here without any back-navigation options);
- **LoginPage**
	- is a place where users authenticate their accounts to access the app’s features;
	- users are prompted to enter their credentials (username and password) to access the app;
	- upon pressing the Log In button, if the login details are correct, the user is directed to the **ShopBranchesPage**;
	- if the login details are incorrect, an error message (*"Invalid username or password"*) is displayed, informing the user of the unsuccessful login attempt;
	- the *Forgot Password* link provides a fallback option for users who cannot remember their credentials, displaying a prompt with instructions to contact the administrator;
- **ShopBranchesPage**
	- is the main page after logging in, where users can view and explore various shop branches available, each displayed as a card;
	- users can scroll through the list, and they may be able to tap on a branch to see more detailed information (the products available in that location);
- **ProductsPage**
